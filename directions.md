# Practice: Python Movie Night Picker

## Overview:

> *Students will be able to use the `random` module and the `random.choice()` method to randomly select a movie genre from a list of movie genres*
>
> *Students will also be able to use the `remove()` method to remove the randomly selected genre from the movie genres list*
>
> *Students will be able to use an `if-else` statement and the Python `len()` function to determine whether a list is empty or not

## Submitting Your Work:

> Save your files to a GitHub repo named: ***movie-night-picker***

## General Requirements

- Add a comment block to the top of your script

```python
# Abraham Lincoln
# 21 APR 20XX
# Intro to Python Variables
```

- Use correct spelling and grammar
- Sprinkle short, ***meaningful*** comments throughout your code
- Use short, descriptive file names
- Use lowercase when naming files

## Directions

- Use the keyword `import` to import the Python `random` module into your script   

- Define a Python list `genres` and add at least four movie genres to it, e.g., comedy, action, romance, etc.   

- Use the Python `random.choice()` method to randomly select a genre from your list of movie genres; save the randomly selected genre to a variable named `genre`   

- Print the randomly selected movie genre   

- Next, use the `remove()` method to remove the randomly selected genre from your list of movie genres   

- Use an `if-else` statement to first check if the list is empty; if the list is empty, tell the user the movie genres list is empty and that the movie genre can't be removed from an empty list; otherwise, remove the randomly selected genre from the list and let the user know which genre was removed from the list
    - HINT: Use the Python `len()` function to find the length of your list!
